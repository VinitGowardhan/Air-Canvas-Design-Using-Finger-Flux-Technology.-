# Air-Canvas-Design-Using-Finger-Flux-Technology.-
This project is a real-time hand gesture-based drawing application that allows users to interact with a virtual canvas using their hands. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, the application tracks hand movements and enables intuitive drawing using finger gestures.
Features
Hand Gesture Tracking: Utilizes MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks for precise gesture-based interaction.
Virtual Drawing Tools: Supports dynamic color selection (blue, green, red, yellow) and a clear canvas option.
Smoothing Algorithm: Implements exponential smoothing to minimize jitter and enhance gesture accuracy.
Real-Time Drawing: Employs deque structures and Bresenham's Line Algorithm for seamless line rendering.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive UI for selecting colors and clearing the canvas, optimized for real-time responsiveness.
